Place your launcher icon image here as `app_icon.png` (prefer 1024x1024 PNG, squared, no rounded corners). After adding the file, run the icon generator:

Windows PowerShell:

```
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

This will generate icons for Android, iOS, Web, Windows, and macOS.
